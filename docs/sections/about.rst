About
=====

HELIOS is an open-source radiative transfer code, which is constructed for studying exoplanetary atmospheres in their full variety. The model atmospheres are one-dimensional and plane-parallel, and the equation of radiative transfer is solved in the hemispheric two-stream approximation with non-isotropic scattering. For given opacities and planetary parameters, HELIOS finds the atmospheric temperature profile in radiative-convective equilibrium and the corresponding planetary emission spectrum.

HELIOS is part of the Exoclimes Simulation Platform (`ESP <http://www.exoclime.net>`_).

The optimal application of HELIOS is in combination with the equilibrium chemistry solver `FASTCHEM <https://github.com/exoclime/FASTCHEM/>`_ and the opacity calculator `HELIOS-K <https://github.com/exoclime/HELIOS-K/>`_. They may be used to compute the equilibrium chemical abundances and the opacities, respectively. The opacity table is constructed with a small k-table generator, included in the HELIOS package.

If you use HELIOS for your own work, please cite its two method papers: `Malik et al. 2017 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...56M>`_ and *Malik et al. 2018, in prep.*

Any questions, issues or bug reports are appreciated and can be sent to *matej.malik@csh.unibe.ch*. 

Thank you for considering HELIOS!
